## Description

BrainBank is a Java-based educational platform that connects university students and tutors. It enables students to find tutors by subject, book private lessons, and track assigned activities. Tutors can manage their availability, assign tasks, and monitor student progress. An administrator role provides access to platform usage statistics and reports. The application supports both a graphical interface (JavaFX) and a command-line interface, with automatic Meet link generation and email notifications for every confirmed booking.

- **Students** can search for tutors by subject, book lessons and receive email notifications
- **Tutors** can manage their availability, assign activities and monitor student progress
- **Administrators** can view reports and statistics on platform usage

## Tecnologies

- Java 17
- Maven
- MySQL
- JavaFX 
- SendGrid API *(notifiche email)*
- Jitsi Meet *(link videolezioni)*

## Architecture
**BCE** (Boundary-Control-Entity)- **MVC** (Model-View-Controller) pattern with clear separation between:
- `controller/applicativo` — business logic
- `controller/cli` — CLI user interface
- `controller/gui` — GUI user interface
- `view/cli` — CLI boundary view
- `view/gui` — GUI boundary view 
- `dao` — data access layer (DB, File, Memory)
- `model` — domain entities
- `bean` — data transfer objects
- `pattern` — GoF patterns (Singleton, Observer, State)

The system supports three peristence mode:
- **DATABASE** — MySQL (full-version)
- **FILE** — JSON (full-version)
- **MEMORY** — in-memory (demo-version)

## Getting started

At startup, the application asks to select the persistence mode:

- `Demo` → simulated in-memory data
- `Database` → MySQL persistence
- `File` → JSON file persistence

Then, the interface must be selected:

- `CLI` → text-based interface
- `GUI` → graphical interface

To use the database mode, create and configure the following file:

```text
src/main/resources/db.properties
```
with the following content:
```text
db.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/brainbankdb
db.user.login=bb_login
db.user.login.password=bb_login
db.user.student=bb_student
db.user.student.password=bb_student
db.user.tutor=bb_tutor
db.user.tutor.password=bb_tutor
db.user.admin=bb_admin
db.user.admin.password=bb_admin
sendgrid.api.key=YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY
```
